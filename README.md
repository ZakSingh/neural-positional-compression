# neural-positional-compression

This codebase provides the implementation for Implicit Neural Video Representation (INVR), a novel technique for encoding video within neural networks. 

All code used for experiments is provided in the `/src` directory. The `video_chunked.ipynb` file provides code to generate the results and charts seen in the paper. 

A conda environment file, `environment.yml`, is provided to ease environment setup. Simply run
`conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate npc` before attempting to run the notebook code.

Please see the Documentation folder for further details.
