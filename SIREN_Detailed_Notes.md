# Siren Notes
The goal of this document is to write down the important elements of the paper ["Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09661.pdf), specifically those that are relevant to our project on neural video compression with implicit representations.

It uses the guidelines from ["How to Read a Paper"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1273445.1273458) adapted to the use case of constructing an experimental design for our project.

As such, it is broken down in four parts parts. The first one contains the relevant four of the "Five C's" from ["How to Read a Paper"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1273445.1273458) answered, this is then followed by a series of applicable ideas from the paper which could be integrated into our project. The final section contains excerpts from the paper (e.g the abstract) for easy future checking during development.
