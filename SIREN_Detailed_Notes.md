# Siren Notes
The goal of this document is to write down the important elements of the paper ["Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09661.pdf), specifically those that are relevant to our project on neural video compression with implicit representations.
